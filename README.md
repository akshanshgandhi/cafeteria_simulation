Simulation of dosa(food court) queue at IIT(BHU) cafeteria to decrease the average waiting time of customer to six minutes. 

This was a coursework project under our professor at Indian Institute of Technology(BHU), Varanasi. The objective was to simulate the customer waiting at dosa (a south indian cuisine) counter, to reduce there average waiting time below 6 minutes. Realtime data was collected by measuring the inter-arrival time, serivce time at cash counter, proportion of customers asking for dosa, service time at dosa counter, all at peak hour of 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. The waiting time at dosa queue was also measured for hypothesis testing i.e. correctness of simulation. Then a parallel dosa counter was simulated for the effect on waiting time.
